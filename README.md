# forge-gfx-sdf-flow

`forge-gfx-sdf-flow` treats graphics as a local verification problem. The Dart implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Forge Gfx Sdf Flow Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## Useful Pieces

- Includes extended examples for render inputs, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents stable output tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## What This Is For

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Project Layout

- `lib`: library code
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Architecture Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps geometry data, layout fixtures, and render inputs in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 165, with risk penalty 7, latency penalty 4, and weight bonus 4. The Dart project uses a small library and assertion script, avoiding package dependencies for verification.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Case Study

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scope

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Expansion Ideas

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more graphics fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Tooling

Install Dart and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.
